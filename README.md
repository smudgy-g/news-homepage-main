## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Solution URL: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/smudgy-g/news-homepage-main)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JQuery

### What I learned

This was a great project to brush up on CSS styling using Grid and Flexbox before starting a SOftware Deevelopment course. I particularly enjoyed adding the menu functionality with JQuery and was quite pleased with the final outcome.

### Continued development

Further animations to menu buttons would be a nice feature (ie. spnning close menu button or increase scale of the menu items on hover)

If there are any suggestions, I'd be happy to see and hear them!

### Useful resources

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [WÂ£ Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - An amazing website that is easy to read and understand.
